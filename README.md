# Toward-Everyday-Spatial-Audio-Capstone_1-TestingPlatform-
Capstone_1 is a modular, reproducible 40 kHz ultrasonic testing platform that integrates Arduino-controlled linear and rotational stages with a MATLAB UI to reassemble hardware, actuate the transmitter, and acquire normalized −90°–90° radiation patterns, with an optional FPGA/driver path for array-level diagnostics.
